# Todolist-fatigue-begone
This simple text-based tool uses a trello to do list to serve up tasks to the user based on how much time and what type of energy they have. I built this as one of my first python projects to help combat decision fatigue -- left to my own devices with my leisure time, it's easy for me to overthink what I could/should be doing with my time. I've primarily built this for personal use, so there's some requirements around trello board setup that may be relaxed if there's interest.

# Requires
packages: trello

To use Todolist-fatigue-begone, you'll first need to set up a trello board with the following configuration:
Lists:   
        To Do
        Done

Labels (label color doesn't matter):
        Home
        Work
        Out

        Mental
        Social
        Physical

        Recurring
        
Then start adding tasks that need doing in the 'To Do' list. To each task, add an estimated size (small (s), medium (m), large (l)). For example, if I might add the following task:
      Add a Todolist-fatigue-begone readme (m)

I would also add the labels 'Home' and 'Mental'.

# Installation

Section to be updated later. Currently not ready for installation by external parties.

# Issues

This code was originally written in 2016, and my skills have grown significantly since then. I'd stopped using the this, but recently felt like picking it up again. I'm curious how github's issue system works, so I thought I'd track my planned changes here.
